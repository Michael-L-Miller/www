As of July 2021, I am a resident physician of pathology, PGY-4, and year-2 neuropathology fellow (AP/NP track) at the NewYorkâ€“Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, with an appointment as a postdoctoral clinical fellow witin the Department of Pathology and Cell Biology at the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. 

In May 2018, I completed my graduate training in the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai's (ISMMS) medical-scientist training program (MSTP), receiving doctoral degrees in medicine and neuroscience. My doctoral thesis in Neuroscience, succesfully presented to my committee in Spring 2016, was conducted in the Laboratory of Molecular Neuropsychopharmacology, Friedman Brain Institute, under the supervision of Yasmin L. Hurd, professor of Psychiatry, Neuroscience and Pharmacology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and director of the Addiction Institute at Mount Sinai. I graduated from Binghamton University in 2010 with degrees in Biochemistry and Integrative Neuroscience, and a certificate in evolutionary studies. 

I am interested in the clinical practice of neuroanatomical pathology, a subspeciality of surgical and autopsy pathology, with the ultimate goal of applying the principles of this discipline to the study of neuropsychiatric illness. To that end, my research interests include (1) understanding the relationship between neurobiology and behavior and (2) identifying environmental and genetic contributors of neuropsychiatric pathophysiology. I am a strong advocate of interdisciplinary science since the novel perspectives that surface from these efforts can potentially advance each field, and ultimately translate into improved patient-centered care.

I am also heavily involved in neuroscience education and community outreach. Starting at Binghamton University, where I developed unique learning programs for Brain Awareness Week, I continued to exercise this passion at Mount Sinai by teaching graduate-level courses in neuroanatomy, neuroscience and pathology, and by participating in annual Brain Awareness Fairs. I am a member of the New York Association of Neuropathologists, known as The Neuroplex, a local community of neuropatholgists whom regularly meet to discuss educational cases in the field. As a pathology resident, I am responsible for teaching pathology to medical students at the affilate medical school.
