AB  - Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy is a subtype of immune-mediated myopathy 
      associated with or without statin use. Statins, or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, 
      are the most prescribed medications for dyslipidemia. The statin-associated 
      myopathic syndromes range from asymptomatic elevations in creatine kinase to 
      severe debilitating muscle weakness with associated rhabdomyolysis and elevated 
      liver enzymes. Clinical improvement occurs upon discontinuation of statins, but 
      some patients do not recover completely. Diagnostic tests include 
      electromyography, muscle biopsy, myositis autoantibody panel, and antibodies 
      against the HMGCR. Here, we present a case of anti-HMGCR-related myopathy 
      associated with atorvastatin.
