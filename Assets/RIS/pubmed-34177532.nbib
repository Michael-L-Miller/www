TI  - A Case of Pediatric Stroke: Osteosarcoma Embolus in the Internal Carotid Artery.
PG  - 269-275
LID - 10.1159/000514089 [doi]
AB  - Stroke in the pediatric population is rare. Despite presentation similar to that 
      seen in the adult patient, the diagnosis in a child can be missed or mistaken for a 
      more common stroke mimic. Due to its rarity, there are no completed pediatric 
      clinical trials investigating best treatment, though guidelines have been 
      extrapolated from adult guidelines and retrospective cohort studies to include some 
      combination of thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. Rarer still is pediatric 
      stroke caused by tumor embolus. We present the case of a young child diagnosed with 
      stroke secondary to osteosarcoma embolism to the left internal carotid artery and 
      review the relevant literature to discuss the considerations and challenges of 
      treatment of stroke in the pediatric population.
