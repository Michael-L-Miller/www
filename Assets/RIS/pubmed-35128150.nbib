AB  - PURPOSE: 1% topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a treatment for ocular surface squamous 
      neoplasia (OSSN) due to its effectiveness, low cost, and tolerable side effect 
      profile. To our knowledge there is no reported sight-threatening corneal 
      complication of 1% 5-FU for the treatment of OSSN. OBSERVATIONS: We report a 78 
      year-old man with bilateral conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) who 
      developed bilateral corneoscleral ulceration and corneal perforation of the left eye 
      after 1% 5-FU topical treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: Our case report 
      describes serious potential complications of 1% 5-FU, reviews possible risk factors 
      associated with poor outcomes, and discusses our treatment approach.
