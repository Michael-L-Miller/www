AB  - The current opioid epidemic necessitates a better understanding of human addiction 
      neurobiology to develop efficacious treatment approaches. Here, we perform 
      genome-wide assessment of chromatin accessibility of the human striatum in heroin 
      users and matched controls. Our study reveals distinct neuronal and non-neuronal 
      epigenetic signatures, and identifies a locus in the proximity of the gene encoding 
      tyrosine kinase FYN as the most affected region in neurons. FYN expression, kinase 
      activity and the phosphorylation of its target Tau are increased by heroin use in 
      the post-mortem human striatum, as well as in rats trained to self-administer heroin 
      and primary striatal neurons treated with chronic morphine in vitro. Pharmacological 
      or genetic manipulation of FYN activity significantly attenuates heroin 
      self-administration and responding for drug-paired cues in rodents. Our findings 
      suggest that striatal FYN is an important driver of heroin-related 
      neurodegenerative-like pathology and drug-taking behavior, making FYN a promising 
      therapeutic target for heroin use disorder.
