AB  - We present the case of a 41-year-old man who developed worsening mid-thoracic 
      back pain and imaging revealed a well-circumscribed intramedullary tumor in the 
      thoracic spinal cord. Subtotal resection was performed, and histopathological 
      analysis showed a cytologically bland, minimally proliferative glial neoplasm. 
      Sequencing revealed H3 K27M and an activating PTPN11 mutation. Serial imaging 
      revealed slow tumor regrowth over a three year period which prompted a second 
      resection. The recurrent tumor displayed a similar low grade-appearing histology 
      and harbored the same H3 K27M and PTPN11 mutations as the primary. While the 
      prognostic importance of isolated H3 K27M in spinal gliomas is well-known, the 
      combination of these two mutations in spinal low grade glioma has not been 
      previously reported. Importantly, PTPN11 is a component of the MAPK signaling 
      pathway. Thus, as building evidence shows that low grade-appearing gliomas 
      harboring H3 K27M mutations along with BRAF or FGFR1 mutations have a relatively 
      more favorable course compared to isolated H3 K27M-mutant midline gliomas, the 
      present case provides new evidence for the prognostic importance of activating 
      mutations in other components of the MAPK signaling pathway. This case further 
      highlights the importance of clinico-radio-pathologic correlation when 
      incorporating evolving genetic data into the integrated diagnosis of rare 
      neuroepithelial tumors.
