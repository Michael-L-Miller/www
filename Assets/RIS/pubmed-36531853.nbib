TI  - Leptomeningeal Disease Secondary to Thr60Ala Transthyretin Amyloidosis: Case 
      Report and Review of the Literature.

AB  - A 31-year-old woman with transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis secondary to a Thr60Ala 
      mutation developed recurrent stroke-like episodes with fluctuating mental status. 
      Evaluation for stroke and seizures was unrevealing. She was found to have 
      leptomeningeal contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging, which was 
      confirmed to be CNS TTR amyloidosis on histopathology following brain and dura 
      biopsy. While leptomeningeal disease has rarely been known to be associated with 
      TTR amyloidosis, this is the first documented case of leptomeningeal disease 
      secondary to a Thr60Ala mutation in the TTR gene. A literature review of TTR 
      amyloidosis is presented with special focus on the treatment of leptomeningeal 
      TTR amyloidosis.
