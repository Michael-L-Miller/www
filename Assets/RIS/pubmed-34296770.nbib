TI  - Pituitary corticotroph tumour with adrenocortical cells: A distinct 
      clinicopathologic entity with unique morphology and methylation profile.
LID - 10.1111/nan.12754 [doi]
AB  - We describe a rare TPIT-positive corticotroph PitNET that is admixed with 
      SF1-positive adrenocortical cells. This dimorphous population of cells showed no 
      colocalisation between TPIT and SF1 by immunofluorescence, and an adrenocortical 
      choristoma was favoured. Methylation array analysis revealed a novel methylation 
      profile in relation to other pituitary neoplasms.
